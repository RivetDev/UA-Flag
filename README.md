# UA Flag Demo
 A small Sega Genesis program that displays the flag of Ukraine in only 64 bytes!
 Made after I saw a discord user by the name of PinoBatch doing something similar on other systems.
 
 Tested on:
	- Bizhawk
	- Regen
	- Everdrive X3
	- Blastem
	
 Known to not work on:
	- Everdrive Pro
	- Kega Fusion
	
 Unknown if it works on hardware without a flashcart. May or may not due to mirroring trick to satisfy TMSS.
 Special thanks to Jorge and Tails8521 for the incredible help and tricks that made this possible!
