# UA Flag Demo
 A small Sega Genesis program that displays the flag of Ukraine in only 64 bytes!
 
 Made after I saw a discord user by the name of PinoBatch doing this on other systems.
 
 Tested on:
- Bizhawk
- Regen
- Gens
- Blastem
- Everdrive Pro & X3
	
 Known to not work on:
- Everdrive Pro
- Kega Fusion
- Ares
	
 Unknown if it works on hardware without a flashcart. May or may not due to a ROM mirroring trick used to satisfy TMSS.
  Will test later. 
 
 Special thanks to Jorge and Tails8521 for the incredible help and tricks that made this possible!
